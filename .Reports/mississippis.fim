Dear Princess Celestia: 100 Mississippis.


Today I learned how to count to one-hundred!

    Did you know that miss was the number 1?

    As long as miss was no more than 100,
        I said miss" Mississippi(s)".
        miss got one more.
    That's what I did!

That's all about how to count to one-hundred!

Your faithful student, Meowflash.
