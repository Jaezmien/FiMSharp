Dear Princess Celestia: Parameters!

I learned how to take multiple parameters using the word x and the number y.
    I said x.
    I said y.
That's all about how to take multiple parameters.

Today I learned how to run a program!

    I remembered how to take multiple parameters using "x" and 1.
    I remembered how to take multiple parameters using "y". (Default value for y)

That's all about how to run a program.


Your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle.
