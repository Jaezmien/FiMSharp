Dear Princess Celestia: Truth machine!


Today I learned how to run a program!

    Did you know that Rarity is the number nothing?
    I asked Rarity.
    If Rarity is equal to 0 then,
        I said 0.
    Otherwise if Rarity is equal to 1 then,
        As long as correct is equal to true,
            I said 1.
        That's what I did.
    That's what I would do.

That's all about how to run a program.


Your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle.
