## Library

Today I learned how to say hello world.
	I said ""Hello World!"".
That's all about how to say hello world.
Your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle."); // You can also use FiMReport.FromFile(string path); to use a path instead.

if( report.MainParagraph != null ) {
	report.MainParagraph.Execute(); // Outputs "Hello World!" into the console.
}
```

# üìù Notes

-   FiMSharp is just a personal hobby project, seeing as FiM++ has never been updated for quite some time now.

-   The syntax used here follows a modified `Sparkle 1.0` syntax, unlike what [fimpp](https://github.com/KarolS/fimpp) uses. Please refer to the sample reports to see the differences.
