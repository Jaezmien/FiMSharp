# üñ• Usage

## Library

```csharp
using FiMSharp;

FiMReport report = new FiMReport(@"Dear Princess Celestia: Hello World!
Today I learned how to say hello world.
	I said ""Hello World!"".
That's all about how to say hello world.
Your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle."); // You can also use FiMReport.FromFile(string path); to use a path instead.

if( report.MainParagraph != null ) {
	report.MainParagraph.Execute(); // Outputs "Hello World!" into the console.
}
```

## CLI

```bash
$ ./fim Reports/hello.fim
Hello World!
```

# üìù Notes

-   FiMSharp is just a personal hobby project, seeing as FiM++ has never been updated for quite some time now.

-   The syntax used here follows a modified `Sparkle 1.0` syntax, unlike what [fimpp](https://github.com/KarolS/fimpp) uses. Please refer to the sample reports to see the differences.

-   ‚ö†üêõ There is still a bug regarding combining statements into one line. Thus, it's still recommended to have statements be on their own line.
