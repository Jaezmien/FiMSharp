# Notes

- FiMSharp is just a personal hobby project, seeing as FiM++ has never been updated for quite some time now.

- The syntax here is different from what [fimpp](https://github.com/KarolS/fimpp) does. You can see the difference in readability in the Brainfuck Interpreter example:

    - [FiMSharp](https://github.com/Jaezmien/FiMSharp/blob/master/.Reports/brainfuck.fim)

    - [fimpp](https://github.com/KarolS/fimpp/blob/master/examples/bf.fimpp)
