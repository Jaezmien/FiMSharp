Dear Princess Celestia: Fizzbuzz!


Today I learned how to play fizzbuzz!

    Did you know that Applebloom is the number 1?

    As long as Applebloom had no more than 100,

        Did you know that Babs Seed is the word ""? (Store the result!)

        If Applebloom modulo 3 is equal to 0 then, (...Is Applebloom divisible by 3?)
            Babs Seed became Babs Seed plus "Fizz".
        That's what I would do.
        If Applebloom modulo 5 is equal to 0 then, (... Is Applebloom divisible by 5?)
            Babs Seed became Babs Seed plus "Buzz".
        That's what I would do.

        (Now we check if result is still empty, which means it's not divisible by 3 or 5!)
        If Babs Seed is equal to the word nothing then,
            Babs Seed became Applebloom. (String conversion!)
        That's what I would do.

        I said Applebloom plus " - " plus Babs Seed.
        Applebloom got one more.

    That's what I did.
    
That's all about how to play fizzbuzz.
