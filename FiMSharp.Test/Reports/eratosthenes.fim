Dear Princess Celestia: Sieve of Eratosthenes!

I learned how to find the primes using the number n to get many numbers.

    Did you know that primes is many numbers?
    If n is no greater than 2 then,
        Then you get primes!
    That's what I would do.

    Did you know that t is many numbers?
    Did you know that sqrt limit is the number square root of a num using n.

    For every number k from 2 to n...
        k of t is 1.
    That's what I did.

    Did you know that i is the number 2?
    As long as i had no more than sqrt limit,
        If i of t is equal to 1 then,
            Did you know that j is the number i times i?
            As long as j had no more than n,
                j of t is 0.
                j became j plus i.
            That's what I did.
        That's what I would do.
        i got one more.
    That's what I did.

    For every number k from 2 to n...
        If k of t is equal to 1 then,
            Did you know that prime index is the number count of an array using primes?
            prime index got one more.
            prime index of primes is k.
        That's what I would do.
    That's what I did.

    Then you get primes!

That's all about how to find the primes.

Today I learned how to run a program!

    Did you know that primes is the numbers how to find the primes using the number 20.
    For every number p in primes...
        I said p. (Expected: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19)
    That's what I did.

That's all about how to run a program.
