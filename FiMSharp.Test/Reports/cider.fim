Dear Princess Celestia: Cider Jugs.


Today I learned Applejack's Drinking Song.

    Did you know that Applejack likes the number 99? (Applejack likes a lot of things...)
    I remembered how to sing the drinking song using Applejack.

That's all about Applejack's Drinking Song!

I learned how to sing the drinking song using the number ciders.

    Did you know that cider is the number ciders?

    As long as cider were more than 1.
        I sang cider" jugs of cider on the wall, "cider" jugs of cider,".
        There was one less cider.
        When cider had more than 1,
            I sang "Take one down and pass it around, "cider" jugs of cider on the wall."!
        Otherwise,
            I sang "Take one down and pass it around, 1 jug of cider on the wall."!
        That's what I would do.
    That's what I did.

    I sang "1 jug of cider on the wall, 1 jug of cider.\nTake it down and pass it around, no more jugs of cider on the wall.\nNo more jugs of cider on the wall, no more jugs of cider.\nGo to the celler, get some more, 99 jugs of cider on the wall.".

That's all about how to sing the drinking song!


Your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle.

P.S. Twilight's drunken state truely frightened me, so I couldn't disregard her order to send you this letter. Who would have thought her first reaction to hard cider would be this... explosive? I need your advice, your help, everything, on how to deal with her drunk... self. -Spike
