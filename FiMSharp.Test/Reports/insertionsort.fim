Dear Princess Celestia: Insertion Sort!

I learned how to insertion sort using the numbers Dashie to get many numbers.

    Did you know that Fluttershy is the number count of an array using Dashie?

    For every number Rarity from 2 to Fluttershy...
        For every number Applejack from Rarity to 2...
            Did you know that Vinyl is the number Applejack of Dashie?
            Did you know that Octavia is the number Applejack minus 1 of Dashie?
            If Vinyl had less than Octavia then,
                Applejack of Dashie is Octavia.
                Applejack minus 1 of Dashie is Vinyl.
            That's what I would do.
        That's what I did.
    That's what I did.

    Then you get Dashie!

That's all about how to insertion sort.

Today I learned how to run a program!

    Did you know that Twilight Sparkle is the numbers 5 and 2 and 7 and 3 and 4 and 7 and 1?
    Twilight Sparkle became how to insertion sort using Twilight Sparkle.
    For every number Spike in Twilight Sparkle...
        I said Spike.
    That's what I did.

That's all about how to run a program.
