Dear Princess Celestia: Recursion!

I learned how to do recursion using the number x!

    When x had more than 0.

        I said x!

        Did you know that y is the number x?
        y got one less.
        I remembered how to do recursion using y.

    That's what I would do.

That's all about how to do recursion.

Today I learned how to make recursion functions!

    Did you know that Twilight is the number 5?
    I remembered how to do recursion using Twilight.

That's all about how to make recursion functions.


Your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle.
