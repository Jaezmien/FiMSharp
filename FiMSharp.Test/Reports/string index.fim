Dear Princess Celestia: String indexing!


Today I learned how to say hello world!
    
    Did you know that Twilight is the word "Twilight Sparkle"?
    Did you know that Spike is the number 1?

    I said Spike of Twilight.

    Spike got one more.

    I said Spike of Twilight.

That's all about how to say hello world.


Your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle.
