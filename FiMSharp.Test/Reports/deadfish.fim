Dear Princess Celestia: Deadfish!

Did you know that Twilight Sparkle is the word "iisiiiisiiiiiiiioiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiioiiiiiiiooiiiodddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddodddddddddddddddddddddsddoddddddddoiiioddddddoddddddddo"?

Today I learned how to run a deadfish program!

    Did you know that Spike is the number 0? (Memory)

    For every character Applejack in Twilight Sparkle...
        If Spike had no less than 256 or Spike had no more than 0 then,
            Spike became 0.
        That's what I would do.

        If Applejack is equal to 'i' then,
            Spike got one more.
        Otherwise if Applejack is equal to 'd' then,
            Spike got one less.
        Otherwise if Applejack is equal to 's' then,
            Spike became Spike times Spike.
        Otherwise if Applejack is equal to 'o' then,
            I quickly said convert a number to char using Spike.
        That's what I would do.
    That's what I did.

That's all about how to run a deadfish program.
