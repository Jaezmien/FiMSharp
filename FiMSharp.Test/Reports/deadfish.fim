Dear Princess Celestia: Deadfish!

Did you know that Twilight Sparkle is the word "iisiiiisiiiiiiiioiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiioiiiiiiiooiiiodddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddodddddddddddddddddddddsddoddddddddoiiioddddddoddddddddo"?

Today I learned how to run a deadfish program!

    Did you know that Spike is the number 0? (Memory)
    Did you know that Rarity is the word nothing? (Output)
    For every character Applejack in Twilight Sparkle...
        If Spike had no less than 256 or Spike had no more than 0 then,
            Spike became 0.
        That's what I would do.

        If Applejack is equal to 'i' then,
            Spike got one more.
        Otherwise if Applejack is equal to 'd' then,
            Spike got one less.
        Otherwise if Applejack is equal to 's' then,
            Spike became Spike times Spike.
        Otherwise if Applejack is equal to 'o' then,
            Did you know that Rainbow Dash is the letter convert a number to char using Spike.
            Rarity became Rarity""Rainbow Dash.
        That's what I would do.
    That's what I did.

    If Rarity is not the word nothing then,
        I said Rarity!
    That's what I would do.

That's all about how to run a deadfish program.
