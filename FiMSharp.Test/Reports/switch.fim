Dear Princess Celestia: Switches!


Today I learned how to do switch cases!

    Did you know that Pinkies Tail is the number 1?

    As long as Pinkies Tail had no more than 5...
        In regards to Pinkies Tail:
            On the 1st hoof...
                I said "That's impossible!".
            On the 2nd hoof...
                I said "There must be a scientific explanation".
            On the 3rd hoof...
                I said "There must be an explanation".
            On the 4th hoof...
                I said "Why does this happen?!".
            If all else fails...
                I said "She's just being Pinkie Pie.".
        That's what I did.

        Pinkies Tail got one more!
    That's what I did.

That's all about how to do switch cases.


Your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle.
