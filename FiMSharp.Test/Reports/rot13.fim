Dear Princess Celestia: Rot13!

I learned how to apply rot13 using a word input to get a word.

    Did you know that output is the word nothing?
    For every character char in input...
        Did you know that char ascii is the number convert a char to num using char?
        Did you know that rotable is the argument false?

        If char ascii had no less than 65 and char ascii had no more than 90 then, (Uppercase)
            rotable became true.
        Otherwise if char ascii had no less than 97 and char ascii had no more than 122 then, (Lowercase)
            rotable became true.
        That's what I would do.

        If rotable is true,
            Did you know that modascii is the number char ascii modulo 32?
            Did you know that addchar is the number -13?
            If modascii had less than 14 then,
                addchar became 13.
            That's what I would do.
            char ascii became char ascii plus addchar.
            Did you know that new char ascii is the character convert a number to char using char ascii?
            output became output plus new char ascii.
        Otherwise,
            output became output plus char.
        That's what I would do.

        
    That's what I did.
    Then you get output!

That's all about how to apply rot13.

Today I learned how to do rot13!

    Did you know that Twilight Sparkle is the word "Hello World!".
    I said Twilight Sparkle.
    Twilight Sparkle became how to apply rot13 using Twilight Sparkle.
    I said Twilight Sparkle.
    Twilight Sparkle became how to apply rot13 using Twilight Sparkle.
    I said Twilight Sparkle.

That's all about how to do rot13!


Your faithful student, Jaezmien Naejara.

P.S. From rosettacode: return string.char(c+(c%32<14 and 13 or -13)) end
