Dear Princess Celestia: Numbers are fun! (Start the class, naming it and its superclass)


Today I learned some math. (Start the mane method. This is the first part that runs)

    I wrote the sum of everything from 1 to 100. (Run the "the sum of all the numbers from 1 to 100" method and print the return value)
    (Expected value: 5051)

That's all about some math. (and now the program has finished running)

I learned the sum of everything from 1 to 100 to get a number. (start of a new method)

    Did you know that the sum was the number 1? (Declare a new variable named "the sum" to be a number, and initialize it to 0)
    Did you know that the current count was the number 1? (Declare a new variable named "the current count" to be a number, and initialize it to 0)

    As long as the current count was no more than 100... (Start a conditional statement that loops while "the current count" is less than or equal to 100)
        the sum became the current count added to the sum. (Increment "the sum" by the value held in "the current count")
        the current count got one more. (Increment "the current count" by 1)
    That's what I did. (End of the loop)

    Then you get the sum! (Return the value held in "the sum")
    
That's all about the sum of everything from 1 to 100. (End of the method)


Your faithful student, Kyli Rouge. (End the class and sign your name)
