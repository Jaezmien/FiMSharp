Dear Twilight Sparkle: Hello World!

Today I learned how to say hello world!

	Did you know that Spike is the number 1?
	Did you know that Owlowiscious is the number 2?
	Did you know that Trixie is the number 3?

	If Spike is equal to Owlowiscious then,
		I said "They are equal!".
	Or else,
		I said "What!".
	Otherwise,
		I said "They are not equal!".
	That's what I would do.

	I said "Hello World!".

That's all about how to say hello world.

Your faithful student, Jaezmien Naejara.
