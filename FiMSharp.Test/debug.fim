Dear Twilight Sparkle: Hello World!

Today I learned how to say hello world!

	Did you know that Spike is the numbers 1 and 2 and 4 and 5 and 6?
	Did you know that Owlowiscious is the number 2?
	I took a break.
	Spike 1 is 2.
	I took a break.
	Owlowiscious of Spike is 3.
	I took a break.

That's all about how to say hello world.

Your faithful student, Jaezmien Naejara.
