Dear Twilight Sparkle: Hello World!

Today I learned how to say hello world!

	 Did you know that Spike is the number 1?

	 While Spike had no more than the number 5...
		I said Spike.
		Spike got one more.
	 That's what I did.

That's all about how to say hello world.

Your faithful student, Jaezmien Naejara.
