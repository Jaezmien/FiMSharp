Dear Princess Celestia: Switches!


Today I learned how to do switch cases!

    Did you know that Twilight is the argument correct?
    Did you know that Spike is the argument correct?

    Did you know that Applejack is the argument correct?
    Did you know that Pinkie is the argument incorrect?
    Did you know that Rainbow is the argument incorrect?
    Did you know that Fluttershy is the argument correct?
    Did you know that Rarity is the argument incorrect?

    (No conditionals)
    If Twilight is equal to Spike then,
        I said "Twilight == Spike[T]".
    That's what I would do.

    (One conditionals, and)
    If Twilight is equal to Spike and Pinkie is equal to Rainbow then,
        I said "Twilight == Spike[T] && Pinkie == Rainbow[T]".
    That's what I would do.

    (One conditionals, or)
    If Twilight is equal to Pinkie or Twilight is equal to Spike then,
        I said "Twilight == Pinkie[F] || Twilight == Spike[T]".
    That's what I would do.

    (Two conditionals, or and)
    If Spike is equal to Pinkie or Spike isn't equal to Rainbow and Spike is equal to Twilight then,
        I said "(Spike == Pinkie[F] || Spike != Rainbow[T]) && Spike == Twilight[T]".
    That's what I would do.

    (Two conditionals, and or)
    If Spike is equal to Rainbow or Spike is equal to Fluttershy and Spike isn't equal to Rarity then,
        I said "(Spike == Rainbow[F] || Spike == Fluttershy[T]) && Spike != Rarity[T]".
    That's what I would do.

    (Three conditionals, or and or)
    If Spike is equal to Rarity or Twilight is equal to Fluttershy and Spike is equal to Applejack or Twilight is equal to Rarity then,
        I said "(Spike == Rarity[F] || Twilight == Fluttershy[T]) && (Spike == Applejack[T] || Twilight == Rarity[F])".
    That's what I would do.

That's all about how to do switch cases.


Your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle.
