Dear Princess Celestia: Arrays!


Today I learned how to make arrays!

    (Without initialized values)
    Did you know that banana is the word "Banana Cake"?
    Did you know that carrot is the number 4? (Pointer - 4)

    Did you know that cake has many words?
    cake 1 is the word "Mango Cake". (Index 1)
    cake 2 is "Strawberry Cake". (Index 2)
    cake 3 is banana. (Index 3)
    carrot of cake is "Carrot Cake". (Index 4)

    carrot got one less.

    I said carrot of cake. (Index 3)

    (With initialized values)
    Did you know that Apples has the words "Gala" and "Red Delicious" and "Mcintosh" and "Honeycrisp"?

    I said Apples 1.

That's all about how to make arrays.
